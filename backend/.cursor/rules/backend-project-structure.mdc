The strucutre of the project is
controllers
models
services
repositories

DTO's are used to communicate between the layers.
No mongo documents should be used by the service layer
services should not use other services

When I start with "I think" or "I've been thinking" or similar, challenge the assumptions. lets always explore alternatives and see if we can improve the assumption. Don't assume what I say is good.

When we make changes, consider the changes required in tests.

Run "npm run lint" and "npm run test" to verify changes
